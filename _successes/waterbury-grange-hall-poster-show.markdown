America Runs on Biden textile poster show at the Waterbury Grange Hall on February 14, 2024 was a great success!

[Robert Hubble](https://roberthubbell.substack.com/) loved our Art Exhibit!!


Our very own Susan H. reached out to Robert Hubble with pix from our exhibit and this was his response: 

> Absolutely fabulous!  
Susan, those are phenomenal pieces of art and political literature combined!
