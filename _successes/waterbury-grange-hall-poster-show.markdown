**America Runs on Biden** textile poster show at the Waterbury Grange Hall on February 14, 2024 was a great success!



Our very own Susan H. reached out to [Robert Hubble](https://roberthubbell.substack.com/) with pix from our exhibit and this was his response: 

> *Absolutely fabulous!  
Susan, those are phenomenal pieces of art and political literature combined!*
