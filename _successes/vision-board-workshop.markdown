*We work from a place of authenticity, strength and resilience in 2024*
~ Susan Hoyt

### What Supports Your Peace and Strength?

To answer that question, IMRV members gathered to create individual vision boards made of images, words, quotes and objects representing what is meaningful and inspirational to us in our daily lives.   At a glance, they show and orient us towards balance, uplift & possibility. This is one of the ways we can each feed our own resilience and good health in 2024.
