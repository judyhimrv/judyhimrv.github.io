This is to let you all know that we had successful meetings with staffers at both our senators offices, in the midst of a snow storm yesterday. IMRV members Susan Werntgen, Pat Folsom, Merle Siiro and myself, Judi Daly, side by side with Indi Calais members Ginny Sassaman and Ulrike Wasmus. We were to also have had more more members and a contingent from Middlebury and Castleton, but the storm had other plans. Ginny wrote a perfect letter expressing not only our fear, but what we need our senators to do. We let them know clearly that this is not a time for business as usual.
We also know that Indivisible Camel's Hump, and Indivisible Addison County also had visits with our Senate offices.
and that the phones in congressional offices, both locally and in DC have been off the charts.
What we are doing is starting to work! Indi National said yesterday that we are being heard now and the Democrats in the senate are starting to wake up to what we need them to do. this is a pic at Welch's office with staffer Ryan McLaren@I
