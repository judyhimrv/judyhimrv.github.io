This peaceful event is happening along Main St. in Waitsfield centered by the gazebo and the Mad River Green. 

### When: Monday, Jan 19 2026, 11 AM to 12:30 PM
### Where: Main St Waitsfield VT by Mad River Green

The event is co-hosted by Indivisible Calais, Indivisible Montpelier, and Indivisible Mad River Valley. Forty Signs of Democracy and Signs of Fascism will be the focal point, though everyone is encouraged and welcome to bring signs and good energy towards the advancement of a free Democracy. We know that people are understandably angry and scared now more than ever - and we should be. It's important, critical, essential that we keep this event peaceful and respectful, by not engaging with disruptors or anti-protestors whether positively or negatively. In heated situations words may not be clearly heard or understood and could be interpreted as provocation. Indivisible is committed to a safe, peaceful event for all. 

### Join us!  We look forward to seeing you there!
