  Script for Calls 1 and 2 (see below for script descriptions)

  Hi, my name is _________ and I'm one of Senator [Welch/Sanders]'s constituents. My zip code is ______.

  I'm also a member of Indivisible Mad River Valley, a group of Warren, VT residents who oppose Trump's agenda.

  I'm calling to ask the Senator to use their influence to bring federal judge nominations to the floor, and then stay in Washington to vote for as many as possible of those federal judges, prior to the Trump administration taking office.  Confirming federal judges who will defend our rights in the courts must be the Senator's most urgent priority.

  I also thank the Senator for being a co-sponsor of the No Kings Act.  No President or Vice President should be entitled to immunity from criminal prosecution for actions that violate the criminal laws of the United States.

  Script for Call 3

  Hi, my name is _________ and I'm one of Governor Scott's constituents. My zip code is ______.

  I'm also a member of Indivisible Mad River Valley, a group of Warren, VT residents who oppose Trump's agenda.

  I'm calling to ask Governor Scott to stand against mass deportation in Vermont.  I urge him to continue enforcement of the 2017 legislation 287(g) agreements, and Vermont Statute 2366 for fair and impartial policing. Immigrant workers are vital to all parts of our Vermont economy.
