Lend a hand to help refugees access sufficient food. At our November meeting, we will be “passing the hat” for donations to the Central Vermont Refugee Action Network (CVRAN). First we raised money for legal expenses in the face of ICE tyranny, now let’s show those who are here that we are with them in the day to day struggle of making it here in Vermont.

As per CVRAN Executive Director Ali Zenie :

> “We’re grappling with a devastating blow: the abrupt loss of SNAP benefits for refugees and asylees. Families who were already navigating impossible choices are now facing empty cupboards and rising fear. We are working to fill this gap, but the scale of need is staggering. We estimate that Central Vermont refugee families are going to collectively lose close to $9,000/month in food assistance. We have set our fundraising target at $150,000. CVRAN will be paying more to support our families, as they pay more to support themselves."

Can't make it to the meeting but would like to donate anyway?
