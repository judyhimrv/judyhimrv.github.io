### Join us and Indivisibles everywhere at noon, April 5th, for a  day of action at our State Capital in Montpelier.

Donald Trump and Elon Musk think this country belongs to them. They're taking everything they can get their hands on and daring the world to stop them. On Saturday, April 5th, we're taking to the streets nationwide to fight back with a clear message: Hands Off!
