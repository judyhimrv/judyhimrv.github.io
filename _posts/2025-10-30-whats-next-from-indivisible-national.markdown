From Leah and Ezra's meeting following the No Kings Protests on 10/18:

 

1. There will be a No Kings Three but not in the immediate future.  Time is needed for rest, then getting more coalition partners as each protest has to be bigger and broader than the last.

 

2. Indivisible is  planning, with partners, some kind of Black Friday action. It has not yet been decided if it will be aimed at specific "bad actors", and promoting only local spending, or more general withholding of all purchasing...STAY TUNED.

 

3.  There have been many outlets suggesting it is time for a general strike.  Leah and Ezra stress that we are not at the point of a national labor strike- more people need to join the movement.  A general strike has to be more widespread to have maximum impact and because there is so much at risk with this action. Indivisible will continue to support targeted economic actions as we build up to a national strike.
