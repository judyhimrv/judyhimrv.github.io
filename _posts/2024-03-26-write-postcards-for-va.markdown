### North Carolina POSTCARDS are coming!

We don't have to tell you how important 2024 and NC is. We need NC to win the White House. 

Can you let us know how many NC postcards you'd be willing to do to help us plan ahead? The campaign STARTS on May 17th but getting early commitment from you is key to helping us plan. And thank you. 

Note from Jeb:
Recently I had the pleasure to be at the Lawson event hosting six penelists with the keynote speaker being Senator Peter Welch. This quote from him got me:

### THE JOY OF EFFORT
~ Sen. Peter Welch

> 'Postcarding is joyful and the effort is greatly needed. Bring them to our monthly meeting this week and share the joy!' 

If you've already signed up - thank you! If not...
