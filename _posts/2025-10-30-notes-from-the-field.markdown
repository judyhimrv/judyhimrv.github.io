.**[Sign a Petition to urge Governor Scott to "Trump-proof" Vermont](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/governors-stand-up-for-our-families/?link_id=8&ca.%E2%80%A663=&email_subject=tonight-learn-to-take-on-the-billionaires&=&emci=e9db311f-7fb2-f011-8e61-6045bded8ba4&emdi=c27d560d-aeb4-f011-8e61-6045bded8ba4&ceid=2500793)**

We are asking you to ‘Trump-proof’ our states by securing the revenue needed and directing it to protect your constituents’ education, health care, housing, access to food and other public services.

While a majority of Americans can’t afford a $1,000 emergency, the recent GOP tax cuts transfers funds dedicated to Medicaid, SNAP, and public services to an increase in federal enforcement agencies like ICE and a massive windfall of tax breaks for the top 5% of high income earners.

 

**[Reject Trump's "Loyalty Oath" Compacts and Sign this petition.](https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/university-administrations-reject-trumps-loyalty-oath-compacts?source=direct_link&emci=e9db311f-7fb2-f011-8e61-6045bded8ba4&emdi=c27d560d-aeb4-f011-8e61-6045bded8ba4&ceid=2500793)**

The Trump administration is trying to blackmail schools to let him and his unqualified bureaucrats run our schools. They want to dictate what schools teach, who they admit and hire, what researchers study, and who's able to be safe at school.  We need to be united and loud in our opposition to this assault on education, and demand that our universities commit to upholding freedom of speech and to providing an affordable, safe education for all.
