  Hi, my name is _____ and I want the Senator to fight Trump’s illegal actions with everything he’s got. Trump is shredding the Constitution, breaking the law and violating the separation of powers.

  I want the Senator to use every tool available to grind Senate business to a halt until Trump stops attacking the constitution. This includes:

  —Opposing all Trump administration nominees

  —Denying any requests for Unanimous Consent

  —Opposing all Cloture Votes

  —Requesting a Quorum Call at every possible opportunity

  Will the Senator commit to refusing any cooperation until this unconstitutional power grab is stopped? I’d like a response in writing, please.
