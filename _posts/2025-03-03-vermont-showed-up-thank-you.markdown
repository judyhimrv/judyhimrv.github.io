### We asked and you answered with a huge Vermont showing.

**Thank you** for all who stood up,

**Indivisible Mad River Valley** thanks everyone who showed up to express their outrage at the current administration on Saturday March 1, while JD Vance and family were on a ski vacation at Sugarbush.

**This peaceful protest** was filled with the passion of approximately 1, 000 people who lined the streets in Waitsfield.   Indivisible members from across the state, members of 50501, and everyday folks, answered our call to use their voices against the Trump/Vance/Musk administration.  Other groups and individuals also engaged in protest actions such as the car parade,  protesting at Sugarbush, putting signs on their property, and more.  We all said no to their hate-filled agenda, their lining the pockets of billionaires while dismantling essential government services, and abandoning Ukraine while allying with Russia.   

**We hope** that more and more people decide to speak up.  We urge you to call your Congressional delegation, continue to protest, and speak with family, friends and neighbors about this administrationâ€™s actions that harm everyday people .

**And we call upon** Sugarbush and other area businesses to remember that what brings people to our beautiful valley is the natural environment and amenities we offer.  As this administration strips the EPA, National Park Service and other departments of money and talent, our environment will suffer.  Please use whatever power and influence you have to protect the governmental services that help protect our landscape so we can continue to attract visitors and residents.
