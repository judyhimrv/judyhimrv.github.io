We're writing Postcards to Swing States!

### It's GO TIME!

Tick Tock - we're running low on time to save our Democracy. You know the stakes...

[Postcards to Swing States](https://www.turnoutpac.org/postcards/) is a program of Progressive Turnout Project, the largest voter contact organization in the country, dedicated to mobilizing Democratic voters and defending democracy.

Sybil will package together the postcards and the addresses - you just need to supply the Stamps! 

NOTE: Postcards stamps are going up to 56 cents each! Buy them 24 hours before July 14th to be sure you get the price now. The current lower price is 53 cents. Buy them while you can and remember... we have more campaigns coming this year so stock up!

[### SIGNUP HERE](http:https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSf_nP9Sm2sSdqNxuutaFdsi_ZW112ERh4LnvakvxscqbJPXkQ/viewform//) - ### THANK YOU 

TWO dates to remember and keep track of (write this down):

Postcards must be mailed on Oct 15th and NOT BEFORE.
Finish them before Aug 3rd and set them aside. We have another campaign coming in August. 

Grab some friends and make it a party!
