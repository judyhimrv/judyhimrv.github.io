Virginia will hold elections for Governor, Lt. Governor, Attorney General, and the House of Delegates in November 2025. Virginia can be a bell-weather state, predicting future election results, so electing candidates who will protect our rights in Virginia this year will be a signal to the rest of the country for 2026. 

That is why we are writing to registered Black voters in Virginia who did not vote in the 2023 VA elections, asking them to vote in the June 17 primary. We know if folks vote in the primary, they are more likely to vote in the General Election.

Here's a sample postcard.

### To join the campaign, meet at Lawson's on Wednesday, March 26th, 4:30-5:30. RSVP to Sybil with the number of postcards you would like and so she can let Lawson's know how many people to expect.
