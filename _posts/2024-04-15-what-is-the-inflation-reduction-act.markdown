The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) is groundbreaking federal legislation that creates millions of new clean energy jobs, makes prescription drugs more affordable, and asks the ultra-wealthy and big corporations to pay their fair share in taxes.

Passed by Congressional Democrats and signed into law by President Biden on August 16, 2022, the bill is a $500 billion investment that delivers what our communities need to thrive. The bill includes benefits in three main areas: clean energy and climate, affordable health care, and tax fairness.
