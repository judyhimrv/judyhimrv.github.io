Join us for Power Hour—anytime between 5 and 7 pm on Sundays and Wednesdays. We'll be working together to make these important calls to voters. THIS IS A WORKING SESSION. NEW PHONE BANKERS MUST BE TRAINED BEFORE ATTENDING. Indicate "None" on your registration and we'll be in touch!

### [Virtual GOTV Phone Banking with Rideshare2Vote! · Mobilize](https://www.mobilize.us/mobilize/event/621253/)

Join us in reaching out to voters to expand their civic engagement by removing transportation as a barrier to voting. Rideshare2Vote realizes that millions of Democratic individuals do not have their voices heard, so we are looking to change that one ride at a time, specifically reaching out to non-voters.Please join us in spreading the word about our Ride2Vote program for people who wouldn't vote if it weren't for our calls and transportation.Using an online, automated calling system, we will inform/remind voters of our program and offer them a free round-trip ride to the polls if they need it!
