Prepare for March 15th, 2025, a day hereafter to be known as #TheIdesOfTrump. Mail your postcards on March 15, The Ides of March. Here's how this came about.

THE IDES OF TRUMP POSTCARD PROTEST - Organized by Notorious Nasty Women, We the People Under Siege, and others.

In observance of the Ides of March, let’s mail President Donald Trump a postcard that publicly expresses our opposition to his words, behavior, and policies. 

Bury the White House post office in postcards informing Donald 
of your position.

Show the media and the politicians what standing with him — and against us — means.

Let this be a record-breaking, officially verifiable, warehouse-filling flood of fury.

They can’t build a wall high enough to stop the mail. 

Write one postcard. Write a dozen!

Spread the word.

Mail your postcard on March 15th to:

President Donald Trump
The White House
1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW, 
Washington, DC 20500.

Post a picture of your postcard on social media tagged with #TheIdesOfTrump.


This idea began on Facebook in a post by Notorious Nasty Women and We the People Under Siege.

We the people, in vast numbers, from all corners of the world, will overwhelm the man with postcards documenting his unpopularity and failure.

We will show the media and the politicians what standing with him — and against us — means. And most importantly, we will bury the White House post office in pink slips, all informing Donnie that he’s fired.

Each of us — every protester from every march, each congress calling citizen, every boycotter, volunteer, donor, and petition signer — if each of us writes even a single postcard and we put them all in the mail on the same day, March 15th, well: you do the math.

No alternative fact or Russian translation will explain away our record-breaking, officially-verifiable, warehouse-filling flood of fury.
Hank Aaron currently holds the record for fan mail, having received 900,000 pieces in a year. We’re setting a new record: over a million
pieces in a day, with not a single nice thing to say.

Sharpen your wit, unsheathe your writing implements, and see if your sincerest ill-wishes can pierce Donald’s famously thin skin.



Write one postcard. Write a dozen! Take a picture and post it on social media tagged with #TheIdesOfTrump ! Spread the word! Everyone on Earth should let Donnie know how he’s doing. They can’t build a wall high
enough to stop the mail.

Then, on March 15th, mail your messages to:

         President (for now) Donald J. Trump
         The White House
         1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW
         Washington, DC  20500.
