Here's what we know about Indivisible National’s Gameplan:

Indivisible groups will lay the groundwork now to win big in the 2026 midterms.  This would puncture Trump’s aura of omnipotence and the idea he has the consent of the governing public for his actions. By flipping the House, democratic representatives can block further (harmful) legislation and regain crucial oversight powers.

The three “big plays” will be:

Indivisibles will all throw in to say NO to the Project 2025 agenda pushed by the White House and Congress. We’ll stop what we can and pick strategic fights to drive national backlash to win in 2026.

Indivisibles will play hardball wherever we’ve got Democrats in local, city, or state office -- pushing them to block, delay, and challenge MAGA’s attacks.

Indivisibles will work to protect and win elections -- defending against election deniers in swing states and turning all that national backlash into an electoral majority coalition that delivers big wins in 2026.  The winners of the 2026 swing state elections will administer the presidential election in 2028 – !

Additionally, Indivisibles must organize to protect communities that will come under threat.
