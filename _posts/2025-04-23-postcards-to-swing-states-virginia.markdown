Starting May 1st, IMRV will order postcards for Virginia, to stand in solidarity with the many federal workers who live there and who have become unemployed.

Postcard addresses come 25 to a page, so please order in batches of 25. The message is relatively short, GOTV, and they do not require Avery labels.They should not be mailed until mid-October.

Please contact Sybil to let her know how many you would like (sybil.sch@gmail.com).
She will organize a Lawson's Postcard party for late May, and organize other pick ups if the party time/place doesn't work for you.
