**Starting May 1st**, IMRV will order postcards for Virginia, to stand in solidarity with the many federal workers who live there and who have become unemployed.

**Postcard addresses** come 25 to a page, so please order in batches of 25. The message is relatively short, GOTV, and they do not require Avery labels. They should not be mailed until mid-October.

**Email Sybil** (sybil.sch@gmail.com) to let her know how many you would like, and watch for a Lawson's Postcard party in late May. Other pick up arrangements can be made if the party time/place doesn't work for you.
