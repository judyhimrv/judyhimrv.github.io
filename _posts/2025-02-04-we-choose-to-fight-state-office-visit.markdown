We are facing a crisis and the Senate must act. This week, plan an in-person appearance at your senator’s office to demand they respond to the Trump administration’s attacks on our communities by refusing to comply. Although the attacks are constant and far-reaching, the focus of these visits is the Trump-Musk funding freeze and the nomination vote of Russell Vought. **Stay tuned for an IMRV announcement about a planned visit perhaps this Thursday, 2/6/25 in Montpelier.**

Since taking office, President Trump and Elon Musk have worked together to defund the federal government from the inside while consolidating power into the hands of a right-wing elite. Their goal is clear: gut federal agencies, strip public resources, and redirect power and money into their own hands. At the same time, Trump and Senate Republicans are fast-tracking Russell Vought as OMB Director to oversee this attack on federal funding. Vought is the architect of Project 2025, and if approved, he will supercharge the ongoing effort to unravel our government and steal our money.

Between Sunday 2/2 and Thursday 2/6, plan a visit to your senator’s office with a group or on your own and demand they shut down the proceedings by leveraging every available second of debate time and refusing unanimous consent on every possible vote. Take posters, props, and anything else you can to get their attention. Record your visit, take pictures, and post them online to demonstrate that there are real people applying real pressure to their Members of Congress.

Deny a Quorum: If Republicans don’t have 51 votes in the chamber, Democrats can walk out and shut down Senate business entirely.

Block Unanimous Consent: Object to every procedural shortcut, forcing Republicans to take the longest possible route for every step of the confirmation process.

Max Out Debate Time: Use all 30 hours of debate on Vought to expose Project 2025, Musk’s Treasury takeover, and the funding freeze.

Delay and Disrupt: Force roll-call votes, quorum calls, and procedural delays to slow everything down.

Blanket Opposition: Democrats cannot continue to vote for Trump’s other nominees, helping to install more MAGA loyalists into powerful positions in the federal government while this power grab continues.

No Business as Usual: This is a constitutional crisis. Democrats must abandon the old rules and fight with everything they have.

It’s time to turn up the heat.
