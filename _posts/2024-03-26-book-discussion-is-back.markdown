We are coming together on May 9th, 5-7 pm at the Moretown Library to discuss the book “*The Persuaders: At the Front Lines of the Fight for Hearts, Minds and Democracy*,” by Anand Giridharadas.  He shares the stories of prominent, effective activists, and what they have learned from their work. It is focused on how to have skillful communication with the folks we often think of as “persuadables” - folks who are receptive to progressive policies, but often are susceptible to right-wing messaging.

It helps us see how to bring more people over to the progressive side without watering down what we are working for, or sliding to the center.   Giridharadas makes the case for creating more on-ramps into the work by focusing on common goals. He provides guidance on finding a way to heal and change our fracturing country.This is a bring your own book event.
