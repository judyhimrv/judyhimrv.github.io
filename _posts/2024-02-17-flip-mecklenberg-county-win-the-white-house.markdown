### It's time for your participation to make that happen...

IMRV is joining a national $500,000 fundraising event as a co-sponsor with Lean Left VT to provide early money to two voter registration groups who plan to reach tens of thousands of unregistered voters of color and young voters in Mecklenburg County.
 
Our **IMRV goal is $2000** towards the Lean Left $25,000 goal, **with two weeks left** to meet that early money goal.

This early money will ramp up field staff who can reach potential voters now instead of five months down the road. They will register them; they will make sure these voters have the information they need to cast their ballots; they will turn them out to vote. **This will be a statewide game-changer come November.**

### * Two weeks left to meet our $2,000 goal

### * Flip Meck County, win the White House
