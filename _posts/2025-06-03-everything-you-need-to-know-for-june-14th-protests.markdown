**EVENT #1: NO KINGS RALLY, BURLINGTON WATERFRONT**

The largest event in Vermont will be a NO KINGS rally, organized by 50501 Vermont, in Burlington. It will include four marches converging at the city’s Waterfront Park, organized by Queen City Indivisible of Burlington, the Vermont Coalition for Palestinian Liberation, and the Resister Sisters. The event will feature speakers and performers, including Vermont Treasurer Mike Pieciak, cartoonist and author Alison Bechdel, Avi Salloway with Miriam Bernardo, and the Solidarity Singers. In addition to information tables and food trucks, the Resister Sisters will organize a die-in. Dozens of protesters, carrying tombstones to memorialize people, programs, and policies under lethal threat from the Trump administration, will lie down, stand, and sit in silence as a stark reminder of what is at stake. 

**EVENT #2: RELAY FOR DEMOCRACY, VERMONT ROUTE 7 CORRIDOR**

In honor of Flag Day, participants in a “Relay for Democracy" will drive a ceremonial American flag along the Route 7 corridor, the backbone of Vermont. The opening ceremony in Williamstown, MA, will take place at 8am, and the closing ceremony in Swanton, VT, at 4:30pm. Along the way, the flag will pass through Bennington, Shaftsbury, Arlington, Manchester, East Dorset, Danby, Mount Tabor, Wallingford, North Clarendon, Rutland, Pittsford, Brandon, Leicester, Salisbury, Middlebury, *New Haven, Waltham, Vergennes, Ferrisburgh, Charlotte, Shelburne, South Burlington, Burlington, Winooski, Colchester, Milton, Georgia, St. Albans Town, St. Albans City, and Swanton. This statewide action will be a peaceful stand against extremism and a powerful reminder: the flag belongs to the people, and democracy belongs to us all. 

*Directly over the mountain from the Mad River Valley, New Haven is the town IMRV has chosen as their gathering point.
