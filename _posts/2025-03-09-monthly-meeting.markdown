**Here's what to look for as we enter a new year...**

Our lanes of engagement are operational! Remember, all lanes lead to the midterms! We don’t need to remind anyone that democracy is in peril; what we need to do is engage in as much as we can in order to rebuild democracy. 2026 is the time  to move a bit out of our comfort zones to engage in actions.    What will your role be? 

**Get Out the Vote**

**Protests/Rallies**

**Policy Actions**

**Fundraising and Support for Non-profits**

**IMRV Community Building**
