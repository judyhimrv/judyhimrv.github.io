Saturday, April 26 from 9- 11 AM, [Braver Angels](https://braverangels.org/) is offering a free workshop at Harwood Union HS in Duxbury, VT for individuals who identify as having "blue-leaning  political views.

The workshop, entitled  "Depolarizing from Within" is designed to to help lessen the effects of polarization that often occur when we find ourselves in challenging political conversations. It introduces skills and techniques to help people reframe how we view ”the other side” in the face of disagreements around politics. The strategies and techniques introduced in this workshop are helpful to enable us to conduct civil conversations with those with whom we disagree. The workshop will be facilitated by Katherine Cadwell and Lincoln Earle-Centers, Braver Angels VT co-coordinators.
