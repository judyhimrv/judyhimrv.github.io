In another expansion of the Trump administration's reign of terror against imigrant families and free speech, ICE is planning a new social media surveillance initiative out of their facility on Industrial Avenue in Williston.  

### Bring noisemakers, signs and your voice. 

### Show Trump, ICE and the landlord that we stand with immigrant families and want ICE out of VT!

### Wednesday, December 10, 5:00 pm, 420 Industrial Avenue, Williston
