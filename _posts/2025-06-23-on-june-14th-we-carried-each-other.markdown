On June 14th—Flag Day and National No Kings Day—over 8,500 Vermonters lined Route 7 for a peaceful protest we called Relay for Democracy: Honoring Our Flag Border to Border.

In just four weeks, neighbors, volunteers, and organizers from across the state brought this grassroots vision to life. Members of Indivisible Mad River Valley were among those who participated. We were united by our shared love for democracy and one another.

Along Route 7 in New Haven, the show of support was powerful. Enthusiastic people lined the road, carried signs, and honked and waved as the flag caravan passed.

The ceremonial flag was owned by Lyle F. Hurtubise, a WWII veteran and Vermont dairy farmer who landed on Utah Beach on D-Day. On June 14, 2025, that flag—and the one that draped his casket—represented not just Lyle, but all veterans and Americans standing up for civil rights, freedom, and justice.

The relay passed through 33 towns with peaceful gatherings in village greens, on mountain trails, and in front yards. What we saw that day wasn't chaos or division—it was courage, community, and quiet strength.

We didn't just carry a flag. We carried each other.

Thank you to everyone who participated, cheered, donated, and stood with us. Democracy only works when we do.
