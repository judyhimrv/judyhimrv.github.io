*We work from a place of authenticity, strength and resilience in 2024*
~ Susan Hoyt

### What Supports Your Peace and Strength?

We will each take this time to enjoy creating our own, very personal vision board made of images \~ possibly also adding words or quotes & tiny objects \~ that represent what awakens and feeds our peace, balance, stability & flexibility, ease, calm, sense of meaning, joy, fortitude & replenishment.

The goal is that each of us will leave with our own composite symbol that, at a glance, will hold us up, bolster us and orient us towards balance, uplift & possibility. This is one of the ways we can each feed our own resilience and good health in 2024.

We look forward to getting together to do some creating.
