We will each take this time to enjoy creating our own, very personal vision board made of images ~ possibly also adding words or quotes & tiny objects ~ that represent what awakens and feeds our peace, balance, stability & flexibility, ease, calm, sense of meaning, joy, fortitude & replenishment. 

The goal is that each of us will leave with our own composite symbol that, at a glance, will hold us up, bolster us and orient us towards balance, uplift & possibility. This is one of the ways we can each feed our own resilience and good health in 2024.
