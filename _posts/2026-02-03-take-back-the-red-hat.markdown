In the 1940s, Norwegians made and wore red pointed hats with a tassel as a form of protest against Nazi occupation of their country. Join the CRAFTIVIST revolution and make your own red protest hat!

“ Within two years, the Nazis made these protest hats illegal and punishable by law to wear, make, or distribute,”


the daughter of the Needle & Skein owner shared that right now, proceeds will be donated to STEP Emergency Assistance to help vulnerable community members pay for rent and legal aid in St. Louis Park, a suburb outside of Minneapolis.

“We also plan to work with other businesses to identify where people most need funds,” she added. “We raised way more than anticipated.”

Those who don’t knit or crochet can also make a donation online to support the efforts.
