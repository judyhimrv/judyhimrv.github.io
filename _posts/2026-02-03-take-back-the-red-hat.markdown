In the 1940s, Norwegians made and wore red pointed hats with a tassel as a form of protest against Nazi occupation of their country. Join the CRAFTIVIST revolution and make your own red protest hat!

### Join us Saturday, February 14, 10 - 3 at afterthoughts, Waitsfield 

### Sit N Knit (or Crochet) Melt the Ice hats

Patterns can be ordered from Needle & Skein in St. Louis Park, MN (PDF download - $5), for either [knit](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/melt-the-ice-hat) or [crochet](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/melt-the-ice-crochet-version) versions. Your pattern purchase will support these designers who are donating the funds raised to the Immigrant Rapid Response Fund in Minnesota.

Otherwise, here’s a similar [free version](https://www.ravelry.com/patterns/library/red-hat-of-resistance---melt-the-ice) to download. We’ll also have some paper copies of this one to share - knit only. Or if you have a pattern of your own, please bring that!


Come prepared with:

* Needles - size for your pattern.  
* Red yarn if you have it. We have some skeins to share until we run out!
* Snack to share if you’re able.
* Drink or water bottle.

Make one for yourself and/or donate one to our protest team!

Those who don’t knit or crochet can also [make a donation online](https://payhip.com/b/fxkOa) and stop by anyway to support the efforts. All are welcome!

“ Within two years, the Nazis made these protest hats illegal and punishable by law to wear, make, or distribute,”


the daughter of the Needle & Skein owner shared that right now, proceeds will be donated to STEP Emergency Assistance to help vulnerable community members pay for rent and legal aid in St. Louis Park, a suburb outside of Minneapolis.

“We also plan to work with other businesses to identify where people most need funds,” she added. “We raised way more than anticipated.”
