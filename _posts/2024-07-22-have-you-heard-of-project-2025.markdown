From Joyce Vance (an American lawyer who served as the United States attorney for the Northern District of Alabama from 2009 to 2017):
“On page 592, there is a proposal that permits employers to avoid paying overtime to employees who work more than a 40 hour work week. They can do that by cutting your hours in subsequent weeks and not paying overtime if they can keep you under 40 hours a week spread across a two or four week period”.  As Joyce says, “that would hurt income for a lot of people who might not see it coming if we don’t warn them”.
