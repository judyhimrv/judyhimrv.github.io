If you haven't heard about Project 2025 then you need to. Look. This is utterly terrifying. As an intro...

From Joyce Vance (an American lawyer who served as the United States attorney for the Northern District of Alabama from 2009 to 2017):
“On page 592, there is a proposal that permits employers to avoid paying overtime to employees who work more than a 40 hour work week. They can do that by cutting your hours in subsequent weeks and not paying overtime if they can keep you under 40 hours a week spread across a two or four week period”.  As Joyce says, “that would hurt income for a lot of people who might not see it coming if we don’t warn them”.
