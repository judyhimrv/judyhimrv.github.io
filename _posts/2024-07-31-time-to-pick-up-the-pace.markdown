This childless cat lady, aka Jeb, is ready to pick up the pace. Are you?

It's crunch time. Judi, Tisa, Karen and Jeb have some important news about how we're going to proceed from now until Election Day. It affects you all. 

You're our core group. The ones who do the work and show up. Tomorrow is our monthly meeting. Please try to make it.
