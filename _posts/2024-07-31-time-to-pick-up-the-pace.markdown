This childless cat lady, aka Jeb, is ready to pick up the pace. Are you?

It's crunch time. Judi, Tisa, Karen and Jeb shared important news about how we're going to proceed from now until Election Day. It was an energetic, action-filled meeting that will buoy our spirits from now till Election Day.   

If you missed it and want to get in on some of the excitement the August meeting generated, please be sure to come to our next meeting on September 5th.
