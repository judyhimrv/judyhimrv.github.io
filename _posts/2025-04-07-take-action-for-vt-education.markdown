**Sample letter you can send to our legislators,** asking them to respond to the Vermont Agency of Education ordering compliance with the Trump administraton's DEI policies.

Subject: Agency of Education compliance re: DEI

To: Dara Torre <DTorre@leg.state.vt.us>, <acummings@leg.state.vt.us>, Andrew Perchlik <aperchlik@leg.state.vt.us>, <awatson@leg.state.vt.us>, <cwhite@leg.state.vt.us>


Please consider adding your names to this [letter of Vermont organizations and legislators](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdqgZb8wgPvjB8K-YRnzKgWcMC8S0iMM6LnIUAXvPHnIlIMkQ/viewform) demanding that Zoie Saunders and the Agency of Education rescind their order of compliance with the current administration's DEI policies. 

As a person who believes deeply in public education for all, this is an abomination and Phil Scott and Zoie Saunders need to hear from us all.

Thank you.

**And thank you for doing your part to keep DEI in Vermont education.**
