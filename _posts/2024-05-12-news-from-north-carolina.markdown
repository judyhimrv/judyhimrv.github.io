### Why support NC now?

* Put "*a dagger in the heart of the trump campaign*" with a Biden/Harris win in North Carolina
* Break the NC legislative supermajority to protect civil and human rights

### What can you do now?

Join our Zoom call on May 19th featuring DANA GOSS of LEAN LEFT VT and JEFF BLUM of All IN FOR NC. Together they will go into detail about why we need to stay focused on North Carolina and Mecklenberg County in particular.
